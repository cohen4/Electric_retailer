# Electric_retailer
This project involved a dataset with over 15,000 rows. The data was cleaned by removing duplicates, filling/removing null values, creating relevant columns, and handling outliers. A connection between Python and SQL was established to build a star schema, followed by business queries to gain insights, which were then visualized.<br>
**The CSV files are necessary for the code to run correctly.**
